    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a sentence \"Dog is crossing the street because it saw the kitchen\".What does it refers to here? It's easy to understand for the humans that it is Dog. But not for the machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "As model proceeses each word, self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues. It will creates a vector based on dependency of each word with the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us go through a step by step illustration of self attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: \n",
    "The first step in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. Each of the vector will be of dimension 1x64.\n",
    "Since we have a multihead attention we will have 8 self attention heads.I will explain the code with 8 attention head in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "How key,queries and values can be created?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have a key matrix,query matrix and a value matrix to generate key, query and value. These matrixes are learned during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "code hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have batch_size=32,sequence_length=10, embedding dimension=512. So after embedding and positional encoding our output will be of dimension 32x10x512.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will resize it to 32x10x8x64.(About 8, it is the number of heads in multihead attention.Dont worry you will get to know about it once you go through the code.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: \n",
    "Second step is to calculate the score. ie, we will multiply query marix with key matrix. [Q x K.t]\n",
    "code hint:\n",
    "Suppose our key,query and value dimension be 32x10x8x64. Before proceeding further, we will transpose each of them for multiplication convinience (32x8x10x64). Now multiply query matrix with transpose key matrix. ie (32x8x10x64) x (32x8x64x10) -> (32x8x10x10).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: \n",
    "Now divide the output matrix with square root of dimension of key matrix and then apply Softmax over it.\n",
    "code hint: we will divide 32x8x10x10 vector by 8 ie, by square root of 64 (dimension of key matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: \n",
    "Then this gets multiply it with value matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "code hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "After step 3 our output will be of dimension 32x8x10x10. Now muliply it with value matrix (32x8x10x64) to get output of dimension (32x8x10x64).Here 8 is the number of attention heads and 10 is the sequence length.Thus for each word we have 64 dim vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: \n",
    "Once we have this we will pass this through a linear layer. This forms the output of multihead attention.\n",
    "code hint:\n",
    "(32x8x10x64) vector gets transposed to (32x10x8x64) and then reshaped as (32x10x512).Then it is passed through a linear layer to get output of (32x10x512).\n",
    "Now you got an idea on how multihead attention works. You will be more clear once you go through the implementation part of it."

    "Now we have gone through most parts of the encoder.Let us get in to the components of the decoder. We will use the output of encoder to generate key and value vectors for the decoder.There are two kinds of multi head attention in the decoder.One is the decoder attention and other is the encoder decoder attention. Don't worry we will go step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us explain with respect to the training phase. Firt\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "First the output gets passed through the embeddin and positional encoding to create a embedding vector of dimension 1x512 corresponding to each word in the target sequence.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Step 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "The embeddig output gets passed through a multihead attention layers as before(creating key,query and value matrixes from the target input) and produces an output vector. This time the major difference is that we uses a mask with multihead attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why mask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mask is used because while creating attention of target words, we donot need a word to look in to the future words to check the dependency. ie, we already learned that why we create attention because we need to know contribution of each word with the other word. Since we are creating attention for words in target sequnce, we donot need a particular word to see the future words. For eg: in word \"I am a strudent\", we donot need the word \"a\" to look word \"student\".\n",
    "\n",
    "code hint\n",
    "For creating attention we created a triangular matrix with 1 and 0.eg:traingular matrix for seq length 5 looks as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 0 0 0 0\n",
    "1 1 0 0 0\n",

    "1 1 1 1 1\n",
    "\n",
    "After the key gets multiplied with query, we fill all zero positions with negative inifinity, In code we will fill it with a very small number to avoid division errors.\n",
    "(with -1e 20)\n",
    "#### Step 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "As before we have a add and norm layer where we add with output of embedding with attention out and normalized it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have another multihead attention and then a add and norm layer. This multihead attention is called encoder-decorder multihead attention. For this multihead attention we create we create key and value vectors from the encoder output. Query is created from the output of previous decoder layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "code hint:\n",
    "Thus we have 32x10x512 out from encoder out. key and value for all words are generated from it. Similary query matrix is generated from otput from previous layer of decoder(32x10x512).\n",
    "Thus it is passed through a multihead atention (we used number of heads = 8) the through a Add and Norm layer. Here the output from previous encoder layer(ie previoud add and norm layer) gets added with encoder-decoder attention output and then normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: \n",
    "Next we have a feed forward layer(linear layer) with add and nom which is similar to that of present in the encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: \n",
